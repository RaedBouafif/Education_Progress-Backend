I am writing to express my strong interest in joining your alternance program at ACTIA. As a recent graduate from ISTIC with a degree in Software Engineering and Computer Science, and with valuable experience in web development, I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to your organization while furthering my professional growth.

During my PFE internship, I had the opportunity to work on a project that involved developing a comprehensive platform for school management, with a specific focus on the web application and integrating an IOT part via RFID technology. Upon the completion of the internship, I was invited to continue working with the company to further enhance the project. I enthusiastically embraced the opportunity and actively participated in adding new features to the web application, ensuring its continuous improvement and functionality. Additionally, we embarked on developing the mobile part of the platform. This ongoing collaboration with the company has not only expanded my technical skills in web and mobile development but has also strengthened my ability to work in a professional team environment, managing complex projects from conception to implementation.

In addition to my internship project, I have also taken on freelance projects where I successfully developed two e-commerce platforms. These experiences allowed me to refine my problem-solving skills, work closely with clients, and meet their specific requirements. Through these engagements, I honed my ability to create user-friendly interfaces, optimize website performance, and ensure smooth functionality.
